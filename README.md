# World Happiness Report

The **World Happiness Report** project analyzes global happiness data to explore the factors that drive happiness across different countries. Using R for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, this project provides insights into how economic, social, and environmental factors contribute to overall happiness.

## Overview

The World Happiness Report is an annual survey that ranks countries based on various measures of well-being. This project involves:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Preparing raw datasets by handling missing values, standardizing variables, and transforming data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating trends and patterns in happiness scores and examining relationships between happiness and factors like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations using `ggplot2` and `plotly` to reveal key trends and comparisons across regions and over time.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Applying regression analysis and correlation studies to understand the drivers of happiness.
- **Interactive Dashboard (Optional):** A Shiny-based dashboard that enables users to interactively explore the data and results.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform raw happiness data for analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts and graphs to help explore country-level and regional trends.
- **Statistical Insights:** In-depth analysis of the key factors influencing global happiness.
- **Reproducible Research:** The entire workflow is documented and reproducible using R scripts and R Markdown notebooks.
